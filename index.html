        		<h2>Cryptography</h2>
        		<p> Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement of digital media.
				</p>	
				<p>Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms. </p>
